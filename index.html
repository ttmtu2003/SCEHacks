                    <p>The current housing market in California is similar to how it was prior to COVID. 
                        Sale prices in many regions have been rapidly increasing within the past few years. 
                        Over last year, median sale price increased by $100,000, averaging above $800,000 in 
                        areas such as Irvine, Fremont, Oxnard, Elk Grove, and San Jose.

                                    Homelessness in California is surging and is higher than all other states combined, with 
                                    the rate of deaths on streets reaching 32% last year. In 2020 alone, 27.89% of California 
                                    citizens experience homelessness. This percentage translates to about 161,548 people.
                                    Some prominent causes of homelessness include a traumatic event, loss of a job, 
                                    the inability to pay for needed health care, or a criminal background got in the way of finding a job.

                            <div class="issue-description">
                                <p>The California Poverty Assessment Report, which takes into account the cost 
                                    of housing and the cost of living, shows that 17.8% of Californians are living 
                                    below the basic standard of living, which is equivalent to 7.1 millions of Californians. 
                                    While the wages remain the same, the cost of housing skyrockets, thus, contributing to 
                                    56% of the cause of poverty. The situation is even worse for Black and Brown renters who 
                                    face intense displacement and gentrification pressures, live in overcrowded and unsafe housing 
                                    conditions, and have fled urban cores for cheaper exurbs over the past two decades.

                            <div class="issue-description">
                                <p>California’s younger generation of middle- and higher-class led to the high housing cost in the state. 
                                    The median home price in California was recorded at $813,980, up 7.2% from March and up 34% from the same period in 2020. 
                                    Even in Silicon Valley that has a higher median income, homebuyers now have to spend about half of their pre-tax income 
                                    on monthly loan payments on the average home. The median home in the Silicon Valley market amounted to $1.2 million at the 
                                    end of 2018, according to Zillow data. Expensive home prices are one of the main reasons many people want to leave California. 
                                    According to statistics from the US federal government, due to the high cost of housing, hundreds of thousands of low- and 
                                    moderate-wage people in California have to leave this place to move to other states to buy a home.

                    <p>The California state government has been working on ways to 
                        reduce the cost of housing. As of September 28, 2021, 
                        Governor Newsom has approved 31 affordable housing bills. 
                        Through these signed bills, Newsom reduces the amount of red tape 
                        and ensures cities provide enough housing. Newsom also dedicated 22 
                        billion dollars to the California Comeback Plan, an action that will 
                        enable the creation of more than 84,000 housing units and opportunities 
                        for the homeless to find homes. 
                    </p>

                    <p>As a part of the signed bills, a new division called Housing 
                        Accountability Unit will be a part of the California Department 
                        of Housing and Community Development to provide the necessary 
                        support to create more housing at the local level.
